```

### As Git Submodule

```
$ git submodule add --depth=1 https://github.com/nicokaiser/hugo-theme-gallery.git themes/gallery
```

## Usage

Page bundles which contain at least one image are listed as album or gallery:

```
contents
|-- _index.md
|-- about.md             <-- not listed in album list
|-- animals
|   |-- _index.md
|   |-- cats
|   |   |-- index.md
|   |   |-- cat1.jpg
|   |   `-- feature.jpg  <-- album thumbnail
|   |-- dogs
|   |   |-- index.md
|   |   |-- dog1.jpg     <-- album thumbnail
|   |   `-- dog2.jpg
|   `-- feature.jpg
|-- bridge.jpg           <-- site thumbnail (OpenGraph, etc.)
`-- nature
    |-- index.md         <-- contains `featured_image: images/tree.jpg`
    |-- images
    |   `-- tree.jpg     <-- album thumbnail, not shown in gallery
    |-- nature1.jpg
    `-- nature2.jpg
```

- `/about.md` is not a Page Bundle and does not have image resources. It is not displayed in the album list.
- `/nature` is a Leaf Bundle (has `index.md` and no children) => displayed as gallery (`single` layout).
- `/animals` is a Branch Bundle (has `_index.md` and has children) => displayed as album list (`list` layout).
- The image resource with `*feature*` in its name or the first image found is used as thumbnail image for album lists.
- Albums without an image are not shown.
- Images in a sub-directory are not shown (here: `nature/images/tree.jpg`). This can be used to provide an album thumbnail that is not shown in the album itself.

### Albums with images and sub-albums

In some cases it might be desirable to show images _and_ sub-albums on one page. To achive this, a local version of `list.html` needs to be added with something like this:

```diff
  {{ define "main" }}
    {{- partial "page_header.html" . -}}
    {{- partial "page_albums.html" . -}}
+   {{- partial "page_gallery.html" . -}}
  {{ end }}
```

In this case, featured images for albums which only contain other albums need to be moved to a sub-directory to avoid being displayed.

### Folders with no images

Albums with no images are hidden by default. This is a design decision to keep the structure as simple as possible and hides pages like `about.md` or `imprint.md` from the album list without the need of defining a layout/section for each gallery.

@baekgaard made a [Pull request](https://github.com/nicokaiser/hugo-theme-gallery/pull/14) about handling of empty albums, which allows to modify this behaviour (which, for simplicity reasons, is not merged).
