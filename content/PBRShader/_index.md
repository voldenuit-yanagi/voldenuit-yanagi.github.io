The Narumi renderer is an offline physically based renderer for research and self-education purpose. Narumi was created almost completely from scratch (except for the building blocks of asset loading). Currently it covers a relatively basic set of features. However, once the foundation has been laid, I should be ready to implement a lot of more advanced techniques. Integration with the recent real-time raytracing technologies is also on the roadmap.

## Current Feature Set

* Bounding volume hierarchy (BVH): Hierarchical Linear BVH and binned-SAH BVH.
* Quasi Monte Carlo samplers.
* Direct lighting integrator.
* Incremental path tracing integrator with Russian roulette.
* Bidirectional path tracing integrator (with multiple importance sampling).
* Volumetric path tracing integrator.
* Area lights (polygonal mesh) and punctual lights.
* Image-based lighting.
* Basic matte, mirror (specular reflection) and glass (speculartransmission) material.
* Microfacet-based material (GGX), both reflection and transmission. Importance sampling based on visible NDF function.
* Unified material model based on the Disney 2015 BSDF.
* Texturing with ray differential anti-aliasing; Bump mapping.
* Homogeneous participant media with common phase functions (isotropic / Henyey-Greenstein).
* Subsurface scattering support based on photon beam diffusion.
Object instancing.
* CPU parallelization via multithreading.
* Custom scene representation to define everything including integrator, camera, geometry, lighting, and material. Conversion between source asset and custom representation is provided.
